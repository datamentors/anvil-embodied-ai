"""Pre-conversion quality scanning for raw MCAP sessions.

Splits into two layers, mirroring the pattern used for action forward-fill
in extractor.py:
  - Pure analysis functions (analyze_topic_coverage, detect_fps_degradation,
    apply_batch_fps_check, apply_batch_topic_presence_check, classify_topic,
    classify_topics, worst_severity) that take already-extracted data and
    are fully unit-testable without any MCAP file I/O.
  - A thin I/O adapter (scan_episode, and its helpers) that reads a real
    MCAP file and feeds the pure functions.

Topic monitoring is config-free: which topics get analyzed, and what role
each plays (camera/joint stream vs. action command), is inferred entirely
from the ROS2 message type recorded in the MCAP's own schema metadata (see
classify_topic). No DataConfig is consulted anywhere in this module.

    Config-free auto-detection can only classify topics that actually exist as declared

    episode's topic list rather than flagged, since there's no config declaring "this
    topic should exist."

    This function closes that gap using cross-episode evidence within the same batch: any
    (topic, role) pair present in a MAJORITY of the batch's episodes is treated as
    "expected." Any episode missing an expected pair gets a synthesized CRITICAL
    "topic completely absent" entry appended to its topic list, and its overall severity

    compare against).

    Design rationale: majority quorum (not "any episode has it") avoids one episode's
    stray/noise topic making every OTHER episode look like it's "missing" something that
    was never actually expected; and avoids false positives for topics that legitimately
    only appear in a minority of episodes (e.g. some rare event-log topic). This does NOT
    replace what a config could express (e.g. "this task always has exactly 4 cameras") —
    it only catches within-batch inconsistency, but that's sufficient for the most common
    real failure mode (a driver completely failing for one episode). Single-episode scans

    Scan one MCAP episode file and produce a full quality report.

    Which topics get analyzed, and what role each plays, is inferred purely
    from each topic's ROS2 message type (see classify_topic) — no config is
    consulted. Topics whose message type isn't one of the known robot-
    pipeline types are still surfaced in the report (role="unclassified",
    severity always PASS) rather than silently dropped.

    validation_mode:
    - "fast" (default): monitored topics use raw MCAP record timestamps, and
      unclassified topics stay strictly informational with avg_fps=None.
    - "strict": all topic timestamps come from the ROS-aware decoded path,
      including avg_fps for unclassified topics when decodable.

    Session start/end are computed from the actual collected message
    timestamps across all analyzable (stream/action) topics — never from
    MCAP summary file-level fields (those reflect the whole file, not any
    single topic, and would misclassify legitimate action-topic idle gaps
    as dropframes).

    If the file itself cannot be opened or parsed, this returns a report
    with severity=CRITICAL, passed=False, no topics, and read_error set to
    a human-readable message — distinct from a genuinely-recorded-but-empty
    file, so a caller (e.g. a CLI) can tell "bad file" from "bad recording."

    Before any MCAP-level scanning, checks the episode's own sidecar
    metadata.json (written by the recorder, one directory up from mcap_path)
    for status="aborted" — the recorder itself already knows an aborted take
    is bad regardless of what its topics look like (an aborted recording can
    still have well-formed, gap-free topic data right up to the moment it was
    cut short, so topic-coverage analysis alone can't catch this). Short-
    circuits straight to CRITICAL without touching the MCAP file at all,
    since there's no reason to spend time scanning a recording the source
    system already flagged as bad.

    This is reported as a normal CRITICAL finding (severity=CRITICAL, a
    populated `topics` entry with its own reason), NOT via `read_error` —
    read_error means "the file itself couldn't be opened/parsed" (a distinct,
    separately-counted "unreadable" bucket in mcap-valid's summary/table). An
    aborted recording is a perfectly readable file with a bad *content*
    verdict, so it must flow through the same severity/reason path as every
    other critical finding to be counted and rendered consistently.
