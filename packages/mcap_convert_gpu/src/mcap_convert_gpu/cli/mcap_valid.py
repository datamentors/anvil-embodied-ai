"""mcap-valid: scan raw MCAP sessions for topic coverage/gap issues before conversion.

Config-free: which topics get analyzed, and what role each plays, is inferred entirely
from each topic's ROS2 message type (see core/quality.classify_topic) — no conversion
config is needed or accepted.

By default (no flags needed), a JSON report and a comprehensive Markdown
report covering every episode and topic are always written inside the input
itself, at <input>/mcap_valid_reports/report.{json,md} (or
<input's-parent>/mcap_valid_reports/<stem>/report.{json,md} for a single
file), in addition to whatever --format / --output produce.

`--topic`/`--max-samples` fold in the old standalone `mcap-inspect` tool's deep
per-message field-structure dump for a single topic (opt-in, off by default).
